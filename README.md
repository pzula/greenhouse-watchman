## SparkCore Greenhouse Temps and Humidity Tracker

Using the SparkCore (a wifi-enabled Arduino for $30) and a DHT-22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor ($6), I am able to get readings from my greenhouse on temperture and humidity. Currently I'm just pinging the API for the information to show on a plain ol' HTML page, but plans are for:

- Storing the data
- Charting the data
- Enabling others to reuse this project

When it's powered on, you can currently see the temperature in my greenhouse here <http://greenhouse-watchman.herokuapp.com/>
